Andrew addresses the gathered team, mentions the Team from Glaxic-Bea, and introduces the man who made it all possible, Professor Al-Abadi. Andrew takes the frontline team elsewhere and breaks down the plan, introducing the team captains Miyamoto, Anya, Rohan, and Santiago.","occurrence":0.1,"time":0,"characters":[0,2,6,7,5]},{"name":"Up to Par?","index":1,"description":"After the meeting, Mei confronts Miyamoto with the intention to fight. She believes his neural implants are not sufficient for surviving in a potentially hostile environment, and challenges him to prove her wrong. They begin to fight, with Miyamoto barely dodging the attacks being thrown by Mei, only thanks to the faster reflexes afforded by his neural implants. After dodging for a bit, Mei is dissatisfied and convinced he is unsuited. At this moment, two of Miyamoto's attack dogs enter the room and engage Mei, showing off their speed and power. She damages one of them, and charges Miyamoto, only to be stopped by Andrew who suddenly enters followed by Luka. Andrew explains that Miyamoto's purpose is not for combat but analysis, at which Mei leaves. Luka bemoans the damaged Attack Dog and takes it for repairs. Andrew and Miyamoto then converse about the mad-scientist nature of many of the people here and how impressive it is for the entire project to be legal. They part ways in preparation for the experiment tomorrow.","occurrence":0.2,"time":0,"characters":[0,1,2,3]},{"name":"Entering a New World","index":2,"description":"The trans-dimensional gate opening is a success. Miyamoto and his robotic companions travel alongside Mei into the gate. They secure the area, at which point the Gate Team enters and begins constructing equipment. Miyamoto sends Cho out while waiting. The Power Team and Defense Team enter once the gate is stabilised. At this point, Miyamoto and Mei begin to explore the surrounding area.","occurrence":0.3,"time":0,"characters":[0,1,2,6,5,7]},{"name":"Exploration and Discovery","index":3,"description":"Miyamoto and Mei talk as they journey, and Miyamoto further explains the extent of his abilities. Through Cho he discovers a village, and is suprised that it is full of humans. He begins to decode their language. He notices that the battery level of his solar-powered devices is lower than it should be, through which he deduces the existence of 'free particles'. Miyamoto and Mei decide to return to the camp with the information they've obtained. As they near the peak of a hill that would put them in range of base camp, they hear Silla shout threats against the Trans-Dimensional team. Moments later, Miyamoto and Mei feel a wave of energy from the magic Silla is preparing.","occurrence":0.4,"time":0,"characters":[0,1]},{"name":"Attack!","index":4,"description":"With the perspective back at base camp, the Defense Team is scrambling. Without Miyamoto's decoded language, they cannot understand the threats being made by Silla. As such, they respond to the clearly aggressive Silla by preparing weapons. As Silla brings down the magic, Rohan fires the Phaser Array in response which nullifies the attack. At this point, a transmission containing language data is received from Miyamoto. Silla follows his attack up with Black Lightning Rain, and Rohan responds by engaging the Energy Barrier. The barrier overloads and breaks, but manages to absorb the attack with only a couple small bolts falling and harming no one. Members of the Defense Team fire at Silla on Rohan's orders, and Silla realizes Rohan is the leader. Silla's Black Lightning auto defense which he cast before the battle blocks the bullets. He then attacks Rohan directly, using Black Flash to close the distance before attacking with a basic spell. Rohan explodes into bits, and the rest of the team begins to panic. Other warriors and mages (a small number) begin to attack the group, as Silla destroys the equipment, closing the Trans-Dimensional Gate. The entire team is wiped out.","occurrence":0.5,"time":0,"characters":[9,6,7,5]},{"name":"Flight","index":5,"description":"Mei wants to rush back to base camp to help, but they are interrupted by one of Silla's scouting division. The team is composed of one mage, Anik, and one warrior, Tulimak. The battle splits up, with Miyamoto taking the mage and Mei the warrior. While the battles happen simultaneously, focus is first given to Mei's fight.
